## R Notebooks
This directory contains several R Notebooks and scripts to reproduce our analysis workflow.

* `chain_analytics.Rmd` checks convergence and auto-correlation of the Gibbs & MH chains
* `corpus_comparison.Rmd` examines the extent to which samples generated from BERT match statistics of its training corpus
* `behavioral_experiment.Rmd` analyses the sentence judgements provided by human participants
  * `gen_stims.Rmd` was used to select balanced sets of sentences to show to participants
