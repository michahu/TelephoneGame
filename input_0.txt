each nonfiction book has a call number on its spine
a dietician goes to college for at least four years
the iris absorbs all of the light waves except blue
some acids you may know are vinegar and lemon juice
the chase leads across a field toward a nearby farm
your teeth begin breaking up the food by chewing it
the raspberry leaves are not very tasty to a rabbit
a fly buzzed over the oilcloth on the kitchen table
the brain helps all parts of the body work together
often the village was burned to the ground by fires
