meadow mice and gophers eat the roots of some weeds
stainless steel is an iron alloy that does not rust
he rides his golden chariot across the sky each day
they went on a short hike one warm autumn afternoon
the nearest patch of native grasses is not far away
failure to be informed on tax matters can be costly
someone probably will hear you if you yell for help
they may extend across the whole width of a glacier
falls are one kind of accident you can help prevent
models of atoms are much larger than the real thing
