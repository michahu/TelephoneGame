goods are exchanged in the market place of an oasis
you may not notice yourself growing from day to day
the discovery of oil has caused many cities to grow
they can read the label and use the medicine safely
a county may have several towns or cities within it
now the plane was going one thousand miles per hour
the molecules that make up the matter do not change
the captain closed the door behind us and bolted it
the third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest
how do you know the difference between hot and cold
